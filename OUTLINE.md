# Course Outline

## Materials

The IPython notebook will be used for all the examples (unless Matlab
is required). Either way, we will try to have everything up on the web
ready to go. If people want to set up the environment on their own
laptops they can.

Many of our examples will come from the basic set of MKS examples.

## Outline

### Introduction to Materials Informatics (0.5 hour, Surya)

 * should cover the entire domain

 * should motivate everything from the mathematics, to the web etc.

 * slide on code of conduct (be friendly, very important to create good atmostphere)

 * introduce Daniel and David

 * what is MKS?

### Introduction to Scientific Programming in Python (1 hour, Daniel)

Some of this stuff might seem a little basic, but TMS is not going to
be full of hacker types. I'll steal some of this from Software Carpentry.

 * Demo the web interface (Wakari or whatever we use)

  * Make sure everyone can log in

  * Explain that those that prefer can use laptops  

 * Overview

  * Why Python

  * Opensource -- explain the license

 * A gentle introduction to Git/Github to example how our materials
   informatics codes are developed.

 * Python containers

 * OOP

 * Numpy arrays

 * IPython notebook
 
### Intro to PyMKS and machine learning (1 hour, David)

 * Intro to Scikit-learn

  * independent example from PyMKS

 * PyMKS

  * General overview

  * Step through a simple example (statistics or MKS, very high level)

  * high level overview of PyMKS -- what problem does it solve?

   * structure of objects

  * Microstructure generation tools   
  
  * data generation tools

### Intro to basic statistics in Python and PyMKS (1 hour, David)

 * Please outline

 * include elastic homogenization

### In depth PyMKS (1 hour, Daniel)

 * Step through elastic MKS

 * Overview of the Cahn-Hilliard example just to show basis functions

 * Go back to elastic model show scaling

 * Optimizing the model -- validation -- parameter optimization.

 * How does the code work? Demonstrate aspects of the code.

### Putting it all together if there is time (1 hour, Daniel and David)

 * Just show some cool stuff

 * An example that uses both MKS and statistics.

 * Optimizing performance in Python.

 * An example on the web that uses PyMKS in real time using Javascript.
