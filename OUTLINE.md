# Course Outline

## Materials

The IPython notebook will be used for all the examples (unless Matlab
is required). Either way, we will try to have everything up on the web
ready to go. If people want to set up the environment on their own
laptops they can.

Many of our examples will come from the basic set of MKS examples.

## Outline

### Introduction to Materials Informatics (1:00 to 1:30, Surya)

 * should cover the entire domain

 * should motivate everything from the mathematics, to the web etc.

 * slide on code of conduct (be friendly, very important to create good atmosphere)

 * introduce David, Yuksel, and Ahmet

 * what is MKS?

### Introduction to Python and PyMKS (1:30 to 2:30 hour, David)

Some of this stuff might seem a little basic, but TMS is not going to
be full of hacker types. I'll steal some of this from Software Carpentry.

 * Demo the web interface (Wakari or whatever we use)

  * Make sure everyone can log in

 * Python

  * Why Python

  * Opensource -- explain the license

  * Python data structures

  * IPython notebook

 * PyMKS

  * General overview

  * Step through a simple example (statistics or MKS, very high level)

  * high level overview of PyMKS -- what problem does it solve?

   * structure of objects

  * Microstructure generation tools

  * data generation tools

### Homogenization Linkages using PyMKS (2:30 to 3:30, Ahmet)

 * 2-point statistics

 * [Checkerboard Example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/materialsinnovation/pymks/blob/develop/notebooks/checker_board.ipynb)

 * Dimensionality reduction of 2-point statistics

 * Microstructure classification example

 * Low dimensional structure property linkages

 * Step through [2D Stress Example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/materialsinnovation/pymks/blob/develop/notebooks/stress_homogenization_2D.ipynb)

 * Add new example

### Localization Linkages using PyMKS (3:30 to 4:30, Yuksel)

 * Step through [2D Elastic MKS Example](http://materialsinnovation.github.io/pymks/rst/elasticity_2D.html)

 * Go back to elastic model show scaling

 * Add new example
